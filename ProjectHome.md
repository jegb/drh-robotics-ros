This project contains the code for my robot projects that leverage ROS (http://www.ros.org/). Particularly it contains all the code for a home made robot that uses ROS, an Arduino controller, and the Kinect sensor to perform SLAM and autonomous navigation based on the ROS navigation stack.

More info can be found on my blog http://www.hessmer.org/blog starting with the first ROS related entry http://www.hessmer.org/blog/2010/11/21/sending-data-from-arduino-to-ros/.
